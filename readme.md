# Simple perceptron solving non linear classification
## Increasing number of dimensions (from 2D) gives single simple perceptron ability to solve non linear problems.
### In this case new dimensions are the distance from classified point to new randomly generated point called "center". Each center is one dimension added to classified point. For example, 2 centers generated, so the point is 4D (x, y, center1_distance, center2_distance).
